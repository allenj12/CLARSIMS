This is a simple simulation to model emotion contagion.
The scenario being modeled is based on the paper barsade(2002):

"This is a simulated managerial exercise in which all the participants act as managers on a salary committee negotiating the allocation
of a limited sum of bonus money to their employees. Each participant was assigned the role of a department head representing a candidate
from his or her own department who had been put forth for a merit bonus increase. Participants were told that they needed to give a
two-to-three minute presentation about their candidate. They were given two mixed-motive goals: (1) to obtain as large a bonus as
possible for their candidate and (2) to aid the committee to make the best use of the available funds and maximize the benefit to the
company as a whole."

One of the agents the "confederate", is there to be the first to give a presentation and to act out 1 of 4 emotional possibilites to
see how it spreads through the group.

We are just using the MS to represent just the “reactive” appraisal of emotion rather than also including the NACS which is shown in
another model. The following drives will be used for each agent excluding the “confederate” which will not even be represented as a
clarion agent since it is only used for communicating affect to the other agents:

Dominance and Power
Affiliation and belongingness
Autonomy
Similance
Fairness
Honor
